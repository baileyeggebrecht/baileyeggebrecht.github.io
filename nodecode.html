            <p>This was a project I completed for Web Applications Development I
            at UM. The requirements were create a website using Django and deploy it using Heroku.
            This was a group project so I worked in a group and we collaborated using GitHub and the SCRUM
            method. I mostly worked on front-end aspects of the project like creating the logo and whatever the user sees. I also did all of our Heroku deployments for each version of the app. I have learned a lot since
            working on this app but I think the main thing I would change in hindsight would be to try to make the design cleaner. I felt like we started with an initial idea of how we wanted the site to work but I think it looks a bit busy with the color scheme now. Also the way I spaced different sections of text makes it hard to read on different screen sizes, so I'd change that as well.</p>
