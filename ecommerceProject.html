            <p>This was a project I completed for Advanced Web Applications Development at UM. The requirements were to use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to create a realistic E-Commerce prototype. My prototype allows users to view products, log in or create a new account, maintain a shopping cart, and purchase items in the cart. In this project I used HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL This project fits into three-tier architecture because the HTML/CSS fits into the presentation tier, or user interface; the PHP fits into the application tier, where data is processed; and the MySQL database information fits into the data tier, where the data associated with the application is. I didn't end up adding a search bar or a filter for the products, so in hindsight I would add those and more products overall. I also ended up basically restarting the website when I was halfway through and changing the style of the pages, so there was some inconsistency in style sheets between pages once I finished it. I only ran the website on Localhost when I was finishing it, but below is a link to my first version of the website. It is missing a lot of elements I added later.</p>
